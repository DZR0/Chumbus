## Subtype

1. ## The Iron Warden

    - Description:
        Iron Wardens are physically resilient warriors who use their mastery over metal to empower their own bodies as weapons. With each strike, they draw on the essence of steel, hardening themselves and intensifying their attacks. The Iron Warden is the embodiment of offense through resilience, becoming stronger the longer they remain in battle.

    - Primary Abilities:

        Hero Ability:
        Steelstrike – Deal 2 damage to an enemy, and gain 1 Armor if the attack hits. This allows the Iron Warden to deal consistent damage while fortifying themselves.

        Heavy Blow:
        Unleash a slow but powerful attack, dealing significant damage to a single target and granting additional Armor if the enemy is stunned or weakened.

        Fortified Stance:
        Enter a defensive stance that grants extra Armor for the next two turns, allowing the Iron Warden to absorb heavy hits.

        Forge Fury:
        For each piece of Armor on the Iron Warden, deal 1 additional damage on the next attack. This ability allows for offensive plays based on accumulated defensive strength.

    Playstyle:
    Durable melee with self-buffing mechanics. Iron Wardens thrive on sustained attacks and benefit from building up Armor while dealing slow but impactful strikes.

2. ## Lore Hook:

    Iron Wardens are seen as the sentinels of the Forge Revenants, bound to guard ancient forges and artifacts. They view the forge as a place of sacred rebirth, and their bodies are treated as extensions of the metal they command.

    The Embercaller

    Description:
    Embercallers are masters of molten metal and flames, combining fire magic with metallic constructs. They focus on creating fiery minions and dealing continuous burn damage to enemies. An Embercaller is a destructive force on the battlefield, wielding the heat of the forge as a relentless weapon.

    Primary Abilities:

        Hero Ability:
        Molten Surge – Deal 1 damage to an enemy and apply a Burn effect, which inflicts 1 damage per turn until dispelled.

        Summon a 2/1 construct that deals burn damage to any enemy it attacks, spreading flames across the battlefield.

        Inferno Armor:
        Temporarily coat the Embercaller or an ally in blazing metal, granting bonus Armor and dealing burn damage to any enemy who attacks them.

        Furnace Blast:
        Unleash a blast of molten metal in an area, dealing damage to multiple targets and applying a stacking Burn effect.

    Playstyle:
    Embercallers excel in sustained area damage and crowd control through fire, creating chaos by spreading burn effects and enhancing allies with fiery buffs.

    Lore Hook:
    Embercallers often come from the deeper forges, where heat and flame rule. They are revered among Forge Revenants for their ability to turn the forge’s fire into a weapon and are both respected and feared for their destructive power.

    The Anvilbound

        Forgemaster’s Blessing – Grant +1 Armor to an ally or construct, providing additional resilience each turn.

        Sacrifice a portion of the Anvilbound's Armor to grant temporary Armor to an ally or servant, redirecting damage.

        Metallic Empowerment:
        Strengthen an ally’s attack by imbuing their weapon with metal, granting a damage boost for the next few turns.
