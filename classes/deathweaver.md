## Subtype

1. ## The Fleshbound Cultist

- Description: 
    Fleshbound Cultists are masters of blood and flesh magic, drawing power directly from sacrifices. Their abilities are often grotesque and visceral, 
    manipulating the bodies of their victims to strengthen themselves or curse their enemies.

- Primary Abilities:

    Hero-Ability:
    Blood Stone - Stores any Blood/Corpses that arose during combat and let the player use this as a resource

    Blood Sacrifice: 
    Sacrifice a portion of their own health or that of a captured enemy or allied servant to unleash powerful spells or regenerate their strength.

    Flesh Shaping:
    Temporarily alter the bodies of foes or allies, either to empower them or weaken them (e.g., causing enemy wounds to reopen).

    Horrors of the Flesh: 
    Summon creatures or minions formed from sacrificed flesh, adding a disturbing, twisted edge to their playstyle.

Playstyle: 
High-risk, high-reward; they can sacrifice health for power and summon grotesque, powerful minions at a cost.

Lore Hook: 
Fleshbound Cultists often draw from forbidden knowledge and may be outcasts, even among other Deathweavers, due to their extreme methods.

2. ## The Harbringer

- Description: 
    The Shadowed Harbinger draws power from the shadows and specializes in fear and manipulation, focusing on psychological control over enemies.
     They are master illusionists and terror-bringers, able to sow chaos and confusion from the darkness.

- Primary Abilities:
    Manifest Dread: 
        Inflict a deep, primal fear that lowers enemy morale or forces them to flee temporarily.

    Shadowbinding: 
        Create chains of shadow to bind and immobilize targets, sapping their will to fight.

    Nightmare Illusions: 
        Summon phantasms that mirror enemies' worst fears, confusing or distracting them.

Playstyle: 
    Stealth and crowd control; they weaken enemies through fear and control the battlefield by manipulating foes from afar.
    
Lore Hook: 
    They’re often seen as the silent assassins of the Deathweavers, slipping into the minds of their prey and leaving enemies mentally broken or haunted.

## Clan

Umbra Veil
    The Umbral Veil might represent a more mystical, disciplined approach, with members who understand death as both a force to wield and respect. They could have a network of archives, hidden libraries, or ancient temples where they study the nature of death itself.

Shroud of Aether 
    In contrast, the Shroud of Aether would be more pragmatic and experimental, possibly using alchemical laboratories, necrotic forges, and summoning chambers to harness death’s raw power. They may push for practical dominance or immortality, seeing death as a tool rather than an entity to respect.
