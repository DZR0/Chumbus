# Game Ideas Collection

Welcome to my collection of game ideas! This repository is a creative space for brainstorming, organizing, and documenting game concepts, mechanics, and prototypes. Here, you’ll find everything from raw brainstorming notes to structured game design documents, diagrams, and sample code snippets.

## Overview

This project serves as a collection of different game ideas and concepts that span various genres and mechanics. It’s intended as a resource for personal projects, inspiration, and potentially open collaboration. The ideas range from simple puzzle games to more complex, story-driven experiences. Each concept includes notes on gameplay, story elements, visual assets, and potential technical implementations.

## Goals

- **Document Game Ideas**: Create a centralized space to organize and expand on game concepts.
- **Inspire and Collaborate**: Share ideas and receive feedback from other developers and creatives.
- **Prototype and Experiment**: Explore basic implementations and test out mechanics or algorithms.

## Contents

Here’s a breakdown of the main sections in this repository:

- **[ideas.txt](./ideas.txt)**: Raw brainstorming notes and quick idea snippets.
- **[gameplay.md](./gameplay.md)**: Detailed descriptions of gameplay mechanics, controls, and objectives.
- **[story.md](./story.md)**: Narrative outlines, character backstories, and plot development.
- **assets/**: Visual aids, like flowcharts and level designs, saved as `.svg` and `.png` files.
- **data/**: Structured data (JSON, YAML) for character stats, items, levels, etc.
- **scripts/**: Code snippets for prototype scripts, algorithms, or mechanics.
- **docs/**: Polished documents, like a comprehensive Game Design Document in PDF format.

## Getting Started

If you're new to this project, here are some ways to explore:

1. **Browse the Files**: Navigate to each section to see the game ideas in different stages of development.
2. **Run Prototype Code**: For a more technical dive, you can run any scripts in the `scripts/` directory using Python. [Instructions here if needed].
3. **View Diagrams**: Check out visual aids in the `assets/` folder to get a better idea of gameplay flow or level layout.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** (optional): If you want to run prototype code files in `scripts/`.
- **Markdown Viewer**: Most files are in Markdown, viewable directly on GitHub.
- **Diagram Software**: To edit `.svg` diagrams, try [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
